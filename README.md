This is a reinterpretation of the piechart in the Open Culture article ["74 Ways Characters Die in Shakespeareâ€™s Plays Shown in a Handy Infographic: From Snakebites to Lack of Sleep"](http://bit.ly/charactersdieshakespeare)

The (cropped) image from Shakespeare's "First Folio" comes from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Title_page_William_Shakespeare%27s_First_Folio_1623.jpg

I decided to make a simple barchart with a background and fancy fonts (just for fun).
